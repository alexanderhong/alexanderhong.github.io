This week, I worked on a few animatic changes before moving over to character modeling in ZBrush. I worked on the character sculpt for the man, based off Celine&#8217;s turnaround for him. Some screenshots are attached below.

<p>This week, I continued working on refining the story and design of the characters with the rest of the team. I also made sure that these changes were consistent across the short, tell the story we want, and reflect the backstory decisions we made last weekend. Revisions to boards were started based on what we discussed. An example of something I boarded can be seen<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/walking.gif" alt="Walking"></p>
<p>I gave edits and guidance as people worked on other parts of the pipeline, from character design feedback to modeling<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>notes.</p>
<p>I’ve also been looking forward to later parts of the pipeline to see what kinds of decisions we’ll need to make as a team. For example, after Friday’s lecture, I spent a couple hours testing the <span class="caps">ACES</span> shading and rendering workflow in RenderMan for Maya based off a random scene that I<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>made.</p>

<p>I worked on storyboard revisions for the first half of the week. This time, the animatic team jamboarded storyboard ideas together to figure out how to best express the story we are trying to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tell.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/jamboard-example.png" alt="Boards"></p>
<p>To make it easier for people to track changes in the story and solidify our short’s overall direction, I also created a slide-deck to break down story beats and the Pillars of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>short.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/story-ppt.png" alt="Powerpoint"></p>
<p>I also did some sketches of character designs and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>stuff.</p>

<p>For this week, I worked on adjusting our storyboards based on guest feedback and gave feedback on people’s character designs. A few of these storyboards can be seen<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>

<p>I also contributed to environment design, trying to define the shape language of the desert and testing out how we can use simple gradients of color to establish the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>atmosphere.</p>

<p>For this week, I worked on developing our short’s style and iterating upon concept art. Over the first few days, I contributed to research and made some early character design<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mockups.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/misc-sketches.png" alt="Character sketches"></p>
<p>Based on Monday’s guest lecture from Megan Gritzfeld, I wrote up a 4-page <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jj6H4vwXn4xipc35a3Upq_s_Fv-56Yrdx3385WwjRiY/">design guideline document</a> for our short that would directly complement our short’s main<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>concepts.</p>
<p>I worked on a number of character design sketches, working on figuring out where to balance the more fantastical look of the desert and the visual language of desert clothing with the background of our<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>character.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/character-sketches.png" alt="Character sketches"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/shapes.png" alt="Demonstrating shape language for character versus background"></p>
<p>I also made a number of boards, some of which have yet to make it into the animatics that we’ve shown in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>class.</p>
