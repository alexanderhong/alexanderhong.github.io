I started off the week by further refining Jon&#8217;s XGen hair from last week. I also helped debug some shaders with Celine and Anny, so that we were finally able to produce some complete renders with Jon, his hair, and his clothing. Seeing these renders made me super excited to see our characters and our short coming together.

<p><img src="/blog/images/jon-fullrender.jpg" alt="Jon rendered with his concept art for comparison"></p>
<p>Towards the end of the week, I shifted to working on testing out Maya to Houdini workflows, since we still intend on using Houdini for Maya<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>simulations.</p>

This past week, I mostly focused on finishing a first pass for Jon&#8217;s hair in XGen. While I&#8217;ve made a few grooms in the past, I used Ali&#8217;s video to do a pure Interactive Groom workflow instead of a XGen / Interactive Groom hybrid. I also added eyebrows and eyelashes to Jon&#8217;s skin and tested blendshapes for a few expressions that we wanted Jon to hit.

Earlier in the week, I worked on finalizing Jon&#8217;s body topology, giving his hands another pass after looking at more topology references online. I also modeled teeth for his mesh, re-organized his file&#8217;s outliner to make it easier to navigate, optimized the scene size and prepared the file for shading. Celine and I worked together to finalize his eye meshes based off of Ali&#8217;s presentation from the other day to make sure it was shading-ready. His UVs from last week somehow got saved over, so I did a couple more passes on his <span class="caps">UV</span> map. Honestly, Jon&#8217;s felt 99% close to completion for a couple weeks, but it felt nice to Really finalize everything in time for shading and rigging to begin in earnest.

I worked on refining Jon&#8217;s topology, focusing a lot on his clothes. I also started some basic shading tests for Jon, without any texture maps.

<p><img src="/blog/images/jon-progress.png" alt="Jon&#39;s topology in a side view and test renders"></p>
<p>I also worked on procedurally generating background dunes with a RenderMan procedural<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>shader.</p>

<h3 id="11/14-11/20" class="anchor">11/14-11/20</h3>
This week, I worked with Connie to help refine the sculpt of the desert, locking some preliminary cameras and doing drawovers on Zoom to help refine how we want the desert to look in each shot.

<p><img src="/blog/images/desert-notes.png" alt="Desert notes"></p>
<p>Admittedly, my progress on Jon this week has slowed somewhat, as my laptop had to be sent in for repairs and I had to spend some time migrating to a new computer. I worked on resizing Jon to real world scale, so that exporting him to Maya results in correctly sized units, and further refined the topology for his clothes. After checking in with Cameron tomorrow, I hope to finish up his clothing and body retopology before class on<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Monday.</p>

This week, we continued to refine our story details, and I continued my role as director in overseeing and signing off on changes to beats. I also continued to iterate on the character model, using feedback from my group and class crit. I also started working on more finalized, simulation-ready topology for the man&#8217;s clothing, using Christine&#8217;s advice and starting the clothes as a one-sided, symmetrical mesh in Maya.

With our story moving forward in a direction that we&#8217;re confident with, I was able to take a bit of a step back from actively working on revising the boards and animatic and focusing on the look of our character models. I refined the character sculpt based on discussions with the and Christine&#8217;s critique on Monday, and also began the process of defining the character&#8217;s low poly topology. I have yet to make the final clothing in Maya or completely fix up the topology in Maya.

<h3 id="10/24-10/30" class="anchor">10/24-10/30</h3>
This week, I worked on a few animatic changes before moving over to character modeling in ZBrush. I worked on the character sculpt for the man, based off Celine&#8217;s turnaround for him. Some screenshots are attached below.

<p>This week, I continued working on refining the story and design of the characters with the rest of the team. I also made sure that these changes were consistent across the short, tell the story we want, and reflect the backstory decisions we made last weekend. Revisions to boards were started based on what we discussed. An example of something I boarded can be seen<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/walking.gif" alt="Walking"></p>
<p>I gave edits and guidance as people worked on other parts of the pipeline, from character design feedback to modeling<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>notes.</p>
<p>I’ve also been looking forward to later parts of the pipeline to see what kinds of decisions we’ll need to make as a team. For example, after Friday’s lecture, I spent a couple hours testing the <span class="caps">ACES</span> shading and rendering workflow in RenderMan for Maya based off a random scene that I<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>made.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/aces-test.png" alt="ACES test"></p>
<h3 id="10/10-10/16" class="anchor">10/10-10/16</h3>

<p>I worked on storyboard revisions for the first half of the week. This time, the animatic team jamboarded storyboard ideas together to figure out how to best express the story we are trying to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tell.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/jamboard-example.png" alt="Boards"></p>
<p>To make it easier for people to track changes in the story and solidify our short’s overall direction, I also created a slide-deck to break down story beats and the Pillars of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>short.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/story-ppt.png" alt="Powerpoint"></p>
<p>I also did some sketches of character designs and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>stuff.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/mirage_sketch.png" alt="Mirage sketching"></p>
<h3 id="10/3-10/9" class="anchor">10/3-10/9</h3>

<p>For this week, I worked on adjusting our storyboards based on guest feedback and gave feedback on people’s character designs. A few of these storyboards can be seen<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>below.</p>

<img src="/blog/images/reach.png" alt="Reach">
<img src="/blog/images/fall.gif" alt="Fall"></p>
<p>I also contributed to environment design, trying to define the shape language of the desert and testing out how we can use simple gradients of color to establish the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>atmosphere.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/desert-sketch.png" alt="Desert sketch"></p>
<h3 id="9/26-10/2" class="anchor">9/26-10/2</h3>

<p>For this week, I worked on developing our short’s style and iterating upon concept art. Over the first few days, I contributed to research and made some early character design<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>mockups.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/misc-sketches.png" alt="Character sketches"></p>
<p>Based on Monday’s guest lecture from Megan Gritzfeld, I wrote up a 4-page <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jj6H4vwXn4xipc35a3Upq_s_Fv-56Yrdx3385WwjRiY/">design guideline document</a> for our short that would directly complement our short’s main<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>concepts.</p>
<p>I worked on a number of character design sketches, working on figuring out where to balance the more fantastical look of the desert and the visual language of desert clothing with the background of our<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>character.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/character-sketches.png" alt="Character sketches"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/shapes.png" alt="Demonstrating shape language for character versus background"></p>
<p>I also made a number of boards, some of which have yet to make it into the animatics that we’ve shown in<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>class.</p>
