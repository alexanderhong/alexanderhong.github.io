This is my portfolio website. It currently reflects only the work I did during
college (ending in 2021).

The site is designed by me and built in Wintersmith, using some of the source code
of the Wintersmith blog template. You can view the repository [here][1].

If you have any questions about my work or just want to chat, feel free to reach
out to me at [alexandervhong@gmail.com][2].
