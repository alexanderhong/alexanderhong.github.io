This is my portfolio website, which is still a work-in-progress. It contains both technical and artistic work that I've done over the past few years. Any illustrations you see on the website are also mine.

The site is designed by me and built in Wintersmith, using some of the source code of the Wintersmith blog template. You can view the repository [here][1].

I'm still in the process of moving stuff over from my older portfolio. In the meantime, you can find my older works (mostly pre-2020 stuff) [here][3]. My illustrations can also be found on [The Daily Californian website][5].

If you have any questions about my work or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at [alexanderhong@berkeley.edu][2]. If you have questions about my editorial and design work, specifically, I'm also reachable at [creativedirector@dailycal.org][4].
