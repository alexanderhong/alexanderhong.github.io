I'm Alexander Hong, though I usually just go by Alex. I'm a Vietnamese American
programmer and illustrator from San Diego, currently based in Los Angeles.
I believe technology should empower us to tell new stories and elevate our craft.
I work as a Technical Director at Skydance Animation. Feel free to reach out if
you want to chat!
