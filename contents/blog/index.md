With our story moving forward in a direction that we're confident with, I was able to take a bit of a step back from actively working on revising the boards and animatic and focusing on the look of our character models. I refined the character sculpt based on discussions with the and Christine's critique on Monday, and also began the process of defining the character's low poly topology. I have yet to make the final clothing in Maya or completely fixed up the topology in Maya.

This week, I worked on a few animatic changes before moving over to character modeling in ZBrush. I worked on the character sculpt for the man, based off Celine's turnaround for him. Some screenshots are attached below.

This week, I continued working on refining the story and design of the characters with the rest of the team. I also made sure that these changes were consistent across the short, tell the story we want, and reflect the backstory decisions we made last weekend. Revisions to boards were started based on what we discussed. An example of something I boarded can be seen below.

I gave edits and guidance as people worked on other parts of the pipeline, from character design feedback to modeling notes.

I've also been looking forward to later parts of the pipeline to see what kinds of decisions we'll need to make as a team. For example, after Friday's lecture, I spent a couple hours testing the ACES shading and rendering workflow in RenderMan for Maya based off a random scene that I made.

I worked on storyboard revisions for the first half of the week. This time, the animatic team jamboarded storyboard ideas together to figure out how to best express the story we are trying to tell.

To make it easier for people to track changes in the story and solidify our short's overall direction, I also created a slide-deck to break down story beats and the Pillars of the short.

I also did some sketches of character designs and stuff.

For this week, I worked on adjusting our storyboards based on guest feedback and gave feedback on people's character designs. A few of these storyboards can be seen below.

I also contributed to environment design, trying to define the shape language of the desert and testing out how we can use simple gradients of color to establish the atmosphere.

For this week, I worked on developing our short's style and iterating upon concept art. Over the first few days, I contributed to research and made some early character design mockups.

Based on Monday's guest lecture from Megan Gritzfeld, I wrote up a 4-page [design guideline document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jj6H4vwXn4xipc35a3Upq_s_Fv-56Yrdx3385WwjRiY/) for our short that would directly complement our short's main concepts.

I worked on a number of character design sketches, working on figuring out where to balance the more fantastical look of the desert and the visual language of desert clothing with the background of our character.

I also made a number of boards, some of which have yet to make it into the animatics that we've shown in class.
