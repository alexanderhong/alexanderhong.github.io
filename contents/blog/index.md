*   [Week of 9/26-10/2](#9/26-10/2)

<h3 id="9/26-10/2">9/26-10/2</h3>

For this week, I worked on developing our short's style and iterating upon concept art. Over the first few days, I contributed to research and made some early character design mockups.

Based on Monday's guest lecture from Megan Gritzfeld, I wrote up a 4-page [design guideline document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jj6H4vwXn4xipc35a3Upq_s_Fv-56Yrdx3385WwjRiY/) for our short that would directly complement our short's main concepts.

I worked on a number of character design sketches, working on figuring out where to balance the more fantastical look of the desert and the visual language of desert clothing with the background of our character.

I also made a number of boards, some of which have yet to make it into the animatics that we've shown in class.
