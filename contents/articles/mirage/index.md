Mirage is a 3D animated short I directed for the course CNM 190 at UC Berkeley.

I worked with a team of 10 other students to make a short film, building a story, assets and animation pipeline from scratch. Since it was a student production, I worked on many parts of the short from story and visdev to character modeling and CFX. Below is a work-in-progress render of our hero character from earlier on in the production.

Additional credits for this render:
* Character concept art: Celine Tang
* Skin shading: Ethan Buttimer
* Additional shading: Celine Tang and Anny Wu

For a more detailed look at the work I put into the short, check out this [blog](../../blog), which ends a couple months before we finished the short.
